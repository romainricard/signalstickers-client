"""
    Python client for the Signal stickers API.
    If you want to understand this code, you must be familiar with Signal
    stickers internals. tl;dr:
     - Everything in packs is encrypted on Signal's side;
     - Each pack has a manifest (`manifest.proto`), which gives the name of
       the pack, its author, and details (`id` and emoji) for the cover sticker
       and each of the stickers;
     - Manifest is serialized with Protocol Buffers;
     - Order of operations is:
        1. Get the manifest and decrypt it;
        2. Get details from the manifest, including stickers id;
        3. For each sticker and the cover, get the image (webp) thankd to their
           id, and decrypt them.

      This is what happens when you open a sticker pack in your Signal client,
      or what we reproduce on signalstickers.com .


    Please do not flood the Signal API (so don't put this code in a `while True` loop).
